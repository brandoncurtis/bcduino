Taking a close look at the datasheet, pin12 is Rset, which sets the DAC full-scale output current.
Rset = 3.9 kohm connected to ground yields full-scale Iout of 10 mA.
Change to 1.95 kohm to increase full-scale Iout to 20 mA.

Iout = 1.248 * 32 / Rset
Iout = 40 / Rset
(mA and kohms)

looks like the voltage on that pin is 1.248V!

if we start with 4 kohms and get 10, dropping to 1 mA requires 40 kohms

SINA  ZOUT1 SINE_OUT1 pin21   analog output of the DAC
SINB  ZOUT2 SINE_OUT2 pin20   complementary analog output of the DAC

q: "Do you know what function R13, the little trimpot, performs?"
a: "Hey Matt, the trimpot adjusts the duty cycle of the square wave output. The AD9850 will output a square wave up to 1 MHz."


Zout appears to be served by R12, a 102 resistor (1 kohm)
