  - I used this EXTENSIVELY to design BridgeServer!

### Setup

mkvirtualenv serial --python=`which python3`
pip install pyserial-asyncio


### Tasks

You can wait for a coroutine or group of coroutines to return in several ways using Task functions.

My favorite is asyncio.wait, which takes a sequence of Futures (or just coroutines, which it wraps in Tasks).
  it returns two sets of futures: (done,pending)
  you can control WHEN it returns, by setting return_when
    use these constants from concurrent.futures: FIRST_COMPLETED, FIRST_EXCEPTION, ALL_COMPLETED

A typical use case, waiting for data from two different datasources and taking an action when either one appears:

    async def echo_server(loop):
      reader,writer = await serial_asyncio.open_serial_connection(url='/dev/ttyACM0', baudrate=9600)
      reader2,writer2 = await serial_asyncio.open_serial_connection(url='/dev/ttyACM1', baudrate=9600)
      while True:
        # returns two sets of futures: (done, pending)
        done, pending = await asyncio.wait([gotmessage(reader, 'ar1'), 
                                            gotmessage(reader2, 'ar2')],
                                            return_when=concurrent.futures.FIRST_COMPLETED)
        for task in done:
          print(task.result())
        for task in pending:
          task.cancel()
        #print("from {}: {}".format(src,message))

Let's say you'd like to do some more complicated things!
You could, for instance, use asyncio.ensure_future() to wrap it in a Future and return a Task (a subclass of Future).
  you could then use add_done_callback() to attach a callback to this Task/Future




## Callbacks vs. Coroutines

Calling a coroutine from asyncio.Protocol.data_received
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29126340/calling-a-coroutine-from-asyncio-protocol-data-received

----

https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-protocol.html#tcp-echo-client-protocol

This demonstrates using create_connection with create_connection and a Protocol lambda function.

https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-stream.html#asyncio-tcp-echo-client-streams

...and this demonstrates creating the same thing using open_connection, which returns (streamreader, streamwriter).

open_connection is described explicitly as "a wrapper for create_connection" that returns a (reader, writer) pair!  This function is a coroutine.
https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-stream.html#asyncio.open_connection

----

"Streams" is describeds as a "coroutine based API"
"Transports and protocols" is described as a "callback based API"

create_connection is described as "low-level", whereas open_connection is "high-level":

"The 'register an open socket to wait for data using a protocol' example uses a low-level protocol created by the AbstractEventLoop.create_connection() method."
https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-stream.html#register-an-open-socket-to-wait-for-data-using-streams

"The 'register an open socket to wait for data using streams' example uses high-level streams created by the open_connection() function in a coroutine."
https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-protocol.html#register-an-open-socket-to-wait-for-data-using-a-protocol

----

https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-protocol.html#coroutines-and-protocols

"Coroutines can be scheduled in a protocol method using ensure_future(), but there is no guarantee made about the execution order. Protocols are not aware of coroutines created in protocol methods and so will not wait for them.

To have a reliable execution order, use stream objects in a coroutine with yield from. For example, the StreamWriter.drain() coroutine can be used to wait until the write buffer is flushed."

### Coroutines in pyserial-asyncio

open_serial_connection:

 """A wrapper for create_serial_connection() returning a (reader,
    writer) pair.
    The reader returned is a StreamReader instance; the writer is a
    StreamWriter instance.
    The arguments are all the usual arguments to Serial(). Additional
    optional keyword arguments are loop (to set the event loop instance
    to use) and limit (to set the buffer limit passed to the
    StreamReader.
    This function is a coroutine.
 """
 


## Weird Errors

ValueError: filedescriptor out of range in select()
