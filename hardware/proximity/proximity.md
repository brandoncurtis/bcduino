"The length of the detector’s output pulse varies in proportion to the amount of light reflected from the object being detected. The logarithmic characteristic of the AGC in the TSSP58P38 results in an almost linear relationship between distance and pulse width."

"The typical application of these devices is a reflective or beam break sensor with active low “detect” or “no detect” information contained in its output. The TSSP4056 is also suitable for fast (~ 5 ms) proximity sensor applications for ranges between 10 cm and 2 m."

"The long reaction and recovery times of the AGC limit the usefulness of the TSSP4P38 to only about two readings per second.  In this application note we introduce a new sensor, the TSSP4056, and an example software program to accomplish the same task in approximately 5 ms."

"Typically, proximity sensors determine an object’s distance by varying the emitter’s drive current to find the threshold emitter power at which the object is just detected, a technique that requires an expensive DAC to drive the emitter. The TSSP4056, however, determines distance by varying the carrier frequency used to drive the emitter between 30 kHz and 54 kHz, thereby finding the threshold frequency at which the sensor just detects the object. This approach doesn’t require the microcontroller to contain a DAC, thus lowering overall solution costs."
